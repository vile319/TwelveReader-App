## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion

Your current Kokoro TTS app is an excellent foundation for TwelveReader. The core functionality is solid, the architecture is sound, and the user experience is already quite good. The upgrade path is clear and achievable.

**The main work is organizational (refactoring) rather than feature development**, which makes this upgrade highly feasible. You're not starting from scratch - you're polishing and expanding an already impressive application.

**Recommended approach**: Start with Phase 1 (refactoring) to clean up the codebase, then move to Phase 2 (core features) to add the missing pieces. This will give you a professional-grade reading app that matches the TwelveReader specification.
